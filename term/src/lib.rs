/*! Terms for kin≈ç.

Real, underlying structures are in module `real`.
Function symbols (`Sym`), constants (`Cst`) and terms (`Term`) are hash consed
for perfect/maximal **and concurrent** sharing.

In the following STS stands for the *SMT Lib Transition System* Standard as
defined in `panic!("undefined")`.

## Handling the state

Terms can have non-stateful variables or stateful variables. Stateful
variables can be either in

* the current state ([`State`][state]`::Curr`), or
* the next state ([`State`][state]`::Next`).

**For SMT Lib 2** the offset of state-variables (*i.e.* unrolling) is given
when printing terms. For more details, see

* trait [`PrintSmt2`][print smt 2] for printing, and
* struct [`Offset2`][offset2] to specify the offset.


## Conventions *when interacting with SMT-solvers*

A state variable `<var>` unrolled at `7` is understood printing/parsing-wise
as `|@7<var>|`. This can be ambiguous depending on how the variables are
sanitized in the STS frontend.

The guideline is that when parsing STS, a variable `<var>` should be sanitized
as a function symbol `| <var>|`. This way, a variable declared in a STS as
`@42my_var` will be sanitized as `| @42my_var|`. It cannot be mistaken for a
stateful variable `|@42my_var|` SMT-Lib-2-wise.


## Parsing

Parsing STS and parsing answers in SMT Lib is different.

* STS is standardized and do not have offsets *per say*. Stateful variables
  are specified with

  *  `(state <my_var>)` to refer to `<my_var>` in the current state, and
  *  `(next  <my_var>)` to refer to `<my_var>` in the next state.

* SMT Lib 2 terms can have arbitrary offsets because when doing a `get-value`
  or a `get-model`, the unrolling will *a priori* mess up the current/next
  convention for terms.
  This is why the [SMT Lib 2 parsing][parse smt 2] trait implementation for
  expressions in [Factory][factory] returns a variable and an
  [`Offset`][offset] option.

## TODO

* [`StateWritable::write`][state writable] for terms copies way too much stuff
* `num::rational` crash if denominator is zero. Can happen in parser. Parsing
only non-zero denominator will push the problem to function symbol application. Need proper handling.
* document [`write` module][write module]
